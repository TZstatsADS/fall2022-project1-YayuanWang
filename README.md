### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2022

+ Projec title: The Story of Philosophy
+ This project is conducted by [Yayuan Wang]

+ Project summary: This project mainly has two goals. The first one is to understand the main idea of each school and find out the overall tendency of philosophical topics. The second one is to figure out whether each school has its own writing style and if it changes over time. Finally, based on what has been done in this project, future improvements are also brought up at the end.
